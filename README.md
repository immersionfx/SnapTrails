## Description of the app

Introducing SnapTrails. The app that revolutionizes the way you see, share, and savor your travels. 

We crafted SnapTrails with the dynamic duo of Google Geospatial Creator and Google's Javascript Map API to make it like a travel diary, but with a sprinkle of AR magic! With SnapTrails, you can follow in the footsteps of fellow explorers and view the world through their lenses - literally! Here's how:

A user embarks on a city tour and utilizes the smartphone app to capture photos or videos of intriguing landmarks during their journey. These media are then securely stored in a cloud database, complete with their geo-coordinates indicating the exact location where each one was taken.

The app then crafts a tailored one-day travel plan by considering the specific route the user took. It strategically designates stops at locations that align with the landmarks and attractions the user found intriguing and captured in photographs or videos during their journey. This individualized itinerary is referred to as a 'trail' within the app. These trails, essentially a curated sequence of recommended stops based on user experiences, form a collection within the app. 

Subsequent users of the app have the option to browse through the available trails, including the one created by the original user. If they choose to follow a particular trail, the app doesn't just show you the way, but it also brings the photo and video memories to life in an augmented world. In other words, you can view these shots as part of the real environment, step into the past, right where that epic sunset photo was taken, and feel like you're walking in the footsteps of your own memories. The app also provides you with a 2D map that displays directions and designated stopping points that correspond to locations where the original user captured the moment during their itinerary.

And what's a journey without a little competition? Rate and be rated! Each of these photos and videos can be rated by fellow travelers by pressing the Like button in AR space. All individual ratings contribute to the overall rating of the entire trail. This approach simplifies the process of discovering the top-rated or recommended trails from the available options when you plan to revisit the city in the future, so you can experience the very best a city has to offer, according to travelers just like you.

Another button allows you to repost your photos and videos on your social media accounts in real time. It's like keeping a live travel blog and sharing your travel adventures with your friends.

If you're ready to turn your travel-shooting memories into an adventure of a lifetime, take a SnapTrail today and explore the world like never before. Embark on an unforgettable journey, one snapshot at a time!
